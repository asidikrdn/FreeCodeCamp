        </header>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          <h3>Hello World</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          <br />
          <code>
            function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          </code>
          <br />
          <code> greetMe("World"); </code>
          <br />
          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
          browser!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>
          <h3>Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <header>
          <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example,
          <br />
          <code>var x = 42;</code>
          <br />
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example,
          <br />
          <code>y = 42;</code>
          <br />
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,
          <br />
          <code>let z = 42;</code>
          <br />
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
        <header>
          <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
          <br />
          <code> if (true) {var x = 5;} console.log(x); // 5 </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
          <br />
          <code>
            if (true) {let y = 5;} console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined
          </code>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
        <header>
          <h3>Global Variables</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
          or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
          frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
          in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
          parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>
          <h3>Data Types</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Six data types that are primitives :
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean</li>
                <li>null</li>
                <li>undefined</li>
                <li>Number</li>
                <li>String</li>
                <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
